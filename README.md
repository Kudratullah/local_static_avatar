# Local Static Avatar

Loads Gravatar's Mystery Man From Local Directory to eliminate requests to gravatar server, improve page load on local development environment.

This is intended for developer uses, please don't use it on production server **unless you know what you are doing**.

This Plugin covers most of the common avatar sizes. In case if it's unable to find a size it will load the highest size available (2048x2048).
